# Spyrograph.
Your task for this project is to write a 'Spyrograph' (a python simulation of a Spirograph). 
The program should allow the user to enter the parameters for a Spirograph drawing, 
and then produce the corresponding picture in a window.

# How to.
Just download project1.py and graphics.py into the same location and then run project1.py! Simple!

# What was implemented?
Welcome, contestant! All these great prizes are yours!
* Your choice of CLI or GUI input methods!
* Your choice of drawing an [Epitrochoid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitrochoid) or a [Hypotrochoid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotrochoid)!
* Checking of incorrect data at just about every possible stage! (Except GUI, cough cough).
* A count of how many graphs you've drawn!
* Prompting whether you want to continue!

Clearly a world of possibility and entertainment for the whole family. Gee whiz.
